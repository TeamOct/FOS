#MAP OBJECTIVES
cl.makingunit = Constructing a "Lord" battle drone...
cl.minetin = Metal detected: Zinc.\nDescription: Used for construction.\nMine this metal for further research.
cl.researchautomation = Using zinc structures, you can automate mining.\nResearch the zinc conveyor belt and the Crude Drill to continue.
cl.placedrills = Now you can automate zinc mining.\nPlace at least 6 drills on zinc ore.\nFurther search for ore patches may be required.
cl.moretin = Zinc will be useful later, so hoarding it is a good idea.
cl.researchdeepdrills = The core has detected an ore underground: Silver.\nResearch the Zinc Drill to start mining.
cl.minesilver = Begin mining silver.
cl.defendfrombugs = [red]Warning![] Aggressive local fauna detected, capable of demolishing structures.\nStrengthen your buildings using walls and use the battle drone's rifle to destroy the insects.
cl.researchupgradecenter = More insects will be coming soon. Research and place the Upgrade Center to enhance your battle drone's rifle.
cl.researchwindturbine = Upgrade Center requires power to function. Windy weather in this planet allows to freely obtain power using Wind Turbines.\nResearch them to continue.
cl.researchwires = Now research Zinc Wires to connect the turbines to any power-consuming block, including the Upgrade Center.
cl.placeturbines = Place Wind Turbines, then connect them all to the Upgrade Center using wires.
cl.researchoredetectors = Weapons made in the Upgrade Center require materials to be constructed.\nYou can find even more ores underground outside the core's scanning zone.\nResearch Ore Detectors and begin scanning the territory.
cl.bugsapproaching = The insects are approaching in a few minutes.
cl.bugstimer = Insects approaching in {0}
cl.defendfrommorebugs = [red]Warning![] A large wave of insects is incoming! Protect the core at all costs!
citadel.spawnwarning = < [red]LEAVE THE SPAWN AREA IMMEDIATELY[] >\n[#ff0000]annihilation imminent[]

hint.fos-insectInvasion = [accent]Insects[] are attacking your factories. Keep in mind they spawn and attack independently of waves.
hint.fos-drillsPoweredByDetector = [accent]Underground drills[] are powered by [accent]ore detectors[] nearby. If a detector is destroyed, all drills around it will stop working, so make sure to protect it.
hint.fos-sandUnderground = You can get [accent]quartz[] by placing an [accent]underground drill[] on a place without ores under it.
hint.fos-detonatorIntro = Surface drills are more efficient than underground drills. You can place the [accent]Surface Detonator[] next to an underground ore to expose it, then mine it with a [accent]surface drill[].
hint.fos-bossHealthScaling = [accent]Guardians[] become progressively stronger with each [accent]player[] present on the sector, partially [red]resisting[] damage done directly by their core units. However, this does not affect [accent]other units and turrets[].
